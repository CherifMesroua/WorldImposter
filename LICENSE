This completes the file and folder architecture for your Word Imposter game project. The structure includes:

1. A React client with components for the game UI
2. A Node.js/Express server with Socket.io for real-time game communication
3. Game logic for managing players, word submissions, questions, and voting
4. Styling for a clean and responsive user interface

To run the project, you would:
1. Install dependencies in both client and server folders
2. Start the server with `npm run dev` in the server folder
3. Start the client with `npm start` in the client folder

The game should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
